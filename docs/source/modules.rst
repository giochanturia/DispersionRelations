Modules
=======

The package consists of the following modules:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   constants
   utils
   kinematics
   dynamics
   integrals


The **constants** module includes a collection of physical and mathematical constants and related functions used throughout the package.
The **utilities** module provides complex functions and statistical methods.
The **kinematics** module accommodates functions necessary for particle kinematics such as phase space functions, etc. (see :ref:`kinematics-section`).
The **dynamics** module houses integration vertices, particle propagators, channel definitions, etc. (see :ref:`dynamics-section`).
The **integrals** module provides numerical integration routines for dispersion integrals.
